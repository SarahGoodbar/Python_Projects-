# About This Repository

This repository contains projects I finish as I learn the basics of coding in Python, through Rice Universityâ€™s online Introduction to Scripting in Python Specialization taught by Scott RIxner and Joe Warren. I really enjoyed the first course, Python Programming Essentials,  and am looking forward to the next three: Python Data Representations, Python Data Analysis, and Python Data Visualization. I plan to include all the projects I complete for the specialization and may add smaller side projects if that makes sense.

This is the first full project in the Python Scripting Specialization. All of the docstrings were included in the template that was generated for students to use in CodeSkulptor. The Owltest Automated Feedback Assessment graded my project at 100%. I am sure it has flaws despite that, but I am not sure what they are. The project is just a short program that introduces the student to the datetime module. It requires several functions to interact correctly to avoid error messages for dates that are out of range, etc. I also learned about modular arithmetic\!
